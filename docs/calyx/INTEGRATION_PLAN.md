# Calyx Integration Plan — Synapse on an Association-Native Database

**Status:** Proposed · 2026-07-15
**Scope:** Replace RocksDB completely with Calyx as Synapse's storage layer, then unlock every Calyx capability (associations, bits, kernel, guard, oracle, provenance, self-optimization) over everything Synapse captures.
**Doctrine:** `BUILDING_ON_CALYX.md` is the build handbook. Encoders only — **no learned embedders**. GPU preferred, CPU fallback. Manual FSV (AGENTS.md D1) gates every step.

## 1. What exists today

### 1.1 Synapse persists 17 RocksDB column families through one facade

All storage flows through `synapse_storage::Db` (`crates/synapse-storage/src/lib.rs`) — `put_batch`, `put_batch_pressure_bypass`, `put_cf_batches_pressure_bypass`, `mutate_batch_pressure_bypass`, `get_cf`, `scan_cf`, `scan_cf_prefix[_from]`, `scan_cf_from`, `scan_cf_tail`, `delete_batch`, `flush`, GC, disk-pressure, sizes/counts. ~155 files consume this facade; none touch RocksDB directly. **This facade is the swap seam.**

| CF | Contents | Key | TTL / caps |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CF_EVENTS` | replay event log (`Event`: seq, ts, source, kind, JSON data, correlations) | `ts_ns‖seq` | 24 h / 2–4 GB |
| `CF_OBSERVATIONS` | perception snapshots (`Observation`: foreground ctx, focused element, a11y nodes, entities, HUD, audio, clipboard, fs events) | seq | 6 h / 0.5–1 GB |
| `CF_PROFILES` | profile registry rows (versions, packages, trust, quarantine…) | id | none / 20–50 MB |
| `CF_MODEL_CACHE` | ONNX model blobs | id | LRU / 1–2 GB |
| `CF_SESSIONS` | MCP session continuity | id | 30 d |
| `CF_REFLEX_AUDIT` | per-reflex audit trail | `ts_ns‖seq` | 7 d |
| `CF_OCR_CACHE` | OCR memoization | region hash | 1 h |
| `CF_TELEMETRY` | metric ring buffer | ts | 6 h |
| `CF_ACTION_LOG` | emitted actions (`Action` enums + humanize params) | `ts_ns‖seq` | 24 h |
| `CF_PROCESS_HISTORY` | process start/exit | ts | 6 h |
| `CF_KV` | generic KV + secondary indexes (e.g. transcript ts-index) | prefixed | none |
| `CF_TIMELINE` | operator activity timeline (`TimelineRecord`: kind, actor, app, payload) | `ts_ns‖seq` | 90 d / 4–8 GB |
| `CF_EPISODES` | derived episodes (`EpisodeRecord`: app, document, url, titles, row/keystroke/click counts, interruptions, boundaries) | `start_ts‖ordinal` | 90 d |
| `CF_ROUTINES` | mined routines (`RoutineRecord`: steps, dow class, minute-of-day, tolerance, support/opportunity days, confidence, evidence) | `rt1-…` id | replace-all |
| `CF_ROUTINE_STATE` | operator lifecycle (confirm/disable/label transitions, confidence history) | routine id | never expires |
| `CF_AGENT_EVENTS` | agent journal (`AgentEventRecord`: kind, spawn, OTel GenAI attrs — model, token usage, tool calls, errors, end state) | `ts_ns‖seq` | TTL+GC |
| `CF_AGENT_TRANSCRIPTS` | normalized agent transcript lines | `spawn_id‖0x00‖line_no` | TTL+GC |

Payloads are JSON (`codecs.rs`; ADR-0001 forbids binary codecs — bytes must stay inspectable). Retention/caps live in `synapse-core/src/retention.rs`. The daemon opens one DB (`daemon_lifecycle.rs`, `SCHEMA_VERSION = 1`).

### 1.2 Calyx (C:\code\calyx-dev, github.com/ChrisRoyse/Calyx-Dev)

Rust 2024 workspace, **compiles clean on Windows** (verified 2026-07-15: `cargo check` on aster/registry/search/forge/assay/lodestar/ward/oracle/ledger/loom/sextant — 53 s, zero errors; aster has explicit `windows-sys` fsync/mmap/pressure paths).

| Crate | Role |
|---|---|
| `calyx-core` | ids (128-bit content addresses), constellation/slot/anchor model, engine traits (`Lens`, `Index`, `VaultStore`, `Estimator`), temporal policy, errors (`CALYX_*` closed catalog) |
| `calyx-aster` | LSM storage engine: WAL + group commit, memtables, SSTs, **MVCC snapshots/time-travel**, manifest, GC, compaction, retention, disk **pressure**, redaction/erase, vault (`AsterVault`: `write_cf_batch`, `read_cf_at`, `scan_cf_range_*`, `pin_reader`) |
| `calyx-aster::cf` | closed `ColumnFamily` enum: `Base, Collections, Relational, Document, Kv, TimeSeries, Blob, Slot, XTerm, TemporalXTerm, Scalars, Anchors, Assay, Ledger, Kernel, Guard, Recurrence, Graph, Online, Reactive, Anneal*` — `Kv` rows carry `version ‖ expires_at ‖ payload` (native TTL) |
| `calyx-registry` | lens registry: frozen contracts, determinism probes, capability cards, admit/park/retire gate, lazy backfill, placement (CPU/GPU), quantization; runtimes: **algorithmic (weightless encoders)**, static-lookup, candle/onnx/tei (embedders — unused here), commissioned |
| `calyx-forge` | math runtime: `Backend` trait (gemm/cosine/dot/l2/normalize/topk), **`CpuBackend` (AVX-512 aware) + `CudaBackend` behind `cuda` feature** (cudarc dynamic-linking), autotune, VRAM budget, quantization |
| `calyx-loom` | cross-terms, agreement graph, abundance, blind-spot detector, reactive triggers, recurrence |
| `calyx-assay` | bits engine: KSG mutual information, sufficiency, redundancy/effective rank, transfer entropy, interaction info, Lomb–Scargle periodicity, CUSUM, MMD drift, Bayesian posteriors, Granger/CCM, admission contract |
| `calyx-lodestar` | grounding kernel: SCC → betweenness → greedy FVS, kernel index/answer, recall gate, grounding gaps, domain bridges |
| `calyx-ward` | fail-closed per-slot guard: conformal calibration, verdicts (accept/new-region/quarantine/refuse), identity-lock, drift, injection lens |
| `calyx-oracle` | prediction: forward/butterfly/reverse walks, energy-descent completion, honesty gate, time-of-next-occurrence, readiness predicate |
| `calyx-ledger` | append-only hash chain, Merkle checkpoints, verify/reproduce, redaction tombstones |
| `calyx-anneal` | reversible shadow-tested self-optimization + tripwires + rollback |
| `calyx-sextant` / `calyx-search` | per-slot indexes (HNSW/DiskANN/SPANN/BM25/MaxSim), RRF fusion, planner, guarded search |
| `calyx-mincut`, `calyx-paths` | graph/path primitives |

`calyx-leapable` proves the intended embedding pattern: an application crate that depends directly on `calyx-aster + calyx-core + calyx-ledger` in-process. Synapse follows the same pattern.

---

## 2. Core decisions

1. **In-process embedding, one durable vault.** New crate `synapse-calyx` owns an `AsterVault` at `%APPDATA%\synapse\vault\`. No daemon-to-daemon hop; Calyx runs inside `synapse-mcp.exe`.
2. **Fork-and-own — Calyx is a blueprint, absorbed as Synapse's code.** The dependency-closed 17-crate set is absorbed into this repo at `calyx/` (nested workspace, `exclude = ["calyx"]`; apps/servers pruned at absorption — see `calyx/README.md`). It is Synapse-owned from that point: fully customizable, expected to diverge, no upstream tracking. `C:\code\calyx-dev` / upstream is reference-only; this repo never builds against it. Calyx-side work (new encoders, pipelines, hardening) is written in `calyx/crates/` as normal Synapse commits.
3. **Keep the `Db` facade, replace its guts.** `synapse-storage` keeps its exact public API; internally a backend enum selects RocksDB or Calyx during migration, then RocksDB is deleted. All 17 CFs become **Kv-family collections** in the vault — keys byte-identical to today (existing key codecs unchanged), values stay JSON (ADR-0001 inspectability preserved). TTL maps to Kv `expires_at`; caps map to aster retention/GC; pressure levels map to aster pressure.
4. **Raw row + constellation, dual representation.** The verbatim JSON row remains the replay/audit source of truth. Alongside it, each intelligence-bearing record is *measured* into a constellation (slots + exact `scalars` + verbatim `metadata` + anchors + provenance) with content-addressed ids (idempotent re-ingest). This is the handbook's Phase 2 "no side store" satisfied in one engine: both live in the same vault.
5. **Encoders only — never embed the explicit.** Every lens is a frozen deterministic `AlgorithmicEncoder`-style instrument (the `Gdelt*` family in `calyx-registry` is the template for adding a `Syn*` family). No candle/onnx/tei lens is ever registered. Structured meaning is measured in **bits**, not cosine-over-embeddings.
6. **GPU preferred, CPU fallback, measured parity.** Build `calyx-forge` with the `cuda` feature (dynamic-linking — no hard CUDA install dependency). At startup: try `CudaBackend::new()`, on error fall back to `CpuBackend::new()`; log the choice, surface it in the `health` tool, enforce CPU↔GPU bit-parity via the forge parity checks.
7. **Manual FSV at every step (AGENTS.md D1).** Every issue's acceptance is a manual FSV: real repo-built daemon, real MCP `tools/call` trigger, then a direct read of the physical SoT (vault bytes / ledger chain / assay rows), with evidence under `docs/fsv/`. Automated tests are supporting evidence only.

## 2.5 Adaptation gap analysis — Calyx is not integration-ready as absorbed

The absorbed crates compile and their engines are real, but a working Synapse integration requires substantial new code (the `[CALYX][ADAPT]` issues):

| Gap | Evidence | Work |
|---|---|---|
| Sync vault vs tokio daemon | `AsterVault` API is synchronous; Synapse's storage contract is an async facade with a WAL-synced group-commit batcher | async facade + batcher (#1692) |
| Windows has never carried a production workload | aster has `cfg(windows)` paths but no daemon soak; AV handles, long paths, lock semantics, sleep cycles untested | durability audit + crash-consistency soak (#1693) |
| No structured-record ingestion | registry ingest paths are text/GDELT-shaped; no JSON-record → typed-fields → panel pipeline, no declarative field schemas | structured measurement pipeline (#1694) |
| Encoder catalog mostly missing | `AlgorithmicEncoder` ships only ByteFeatures/Scalar/OneHot/AstStyle/SparseKeywords/TokenHash + GDELT; cyclic, scalar variants, multi-hot, record-vector, ordinal, binning, frequency, target/mean, lag/delta, interactions, aggregations, graph-structural do not exist | `Syn*` encoders as new calyx-registry code (#1663 + #1685) |
| GPU coverage partial | #1695 ships first-class `Backend::knn` and `Backend::paired_cosine` for Loom agreement batching; `FORGE_DEFERRED_BACKEND_OPS` now names only measured CPU-routed ops (`histogram_nmi`, `spmm_sparse_ops`, `graph_ops`, `colbert_maxsim`) | use the #1695 profile/routing contract; add more GPU ops only after a real Synapse profile proves CPU is the bottleneck |
| No Synapse bridges | CALYX_* errors, config knobs, and clock injection are not wired to Synapse's error-code regime, config, or deterministic test clock | error/config/clock bridges (#1696) |

## 3. Domain → panel → anchor mapping (the atoms)

Per the handbook's foundational principle: decompose to atoms, compute **all** base associations, anchor real outcomes.

### 3.1 Panels (all deterministic encoder lenses)

**Shared `Syn*` encoder family** (new algorithmic encoders, each a frozen content-addressed lens with a determinism probe):
- `syn-cyclic-time` — hour-of-day, day-of-week, day-of-month → sin/cos pairs
- `syn-scalar-{raw,log1p,zscore,rank}` — one lens per normalization per numeric field
- `syn-onehot-{kind,actor,boundary,endstate,errortype,level}` — low-cardinality enums
- `syn-hash-{app,process,document,urlhost,tool,model}` — high-cardinality identity via feature hashing
- `syn-sparse-title` / `syn-sparse-text` — `SparseKeywords` over window titles / message text (BM25-able)
- `syn-multihot-flags` — boolean sets (fullscreen, dwm, patterns…)
- `syn-record-vector` — unit-normed assembly of all numeric fields (find-similar without embedding)
- `syn-temporal-{recency,periodic,positional}` — calyx-core temporal lenses, retrieval-only boosts
- derived features: `syn-rate-*` (keystrokes/min, clicks/min, tokens/sec, cost/task), `syn-duration`, `syn-interruption-ratio`

**Panels per domain:**

| Domain (source CF) | Slots (examples) | Scalars (exact) | Metadata (verbatim) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Timeline events | kind one-hot, app hash, title sparse, cyclic time, actor one-hot, recency | ts | app, title excerpt |
| Episodes | app hash, document hash, url-host hash, title sparse, cyclic start-time, duration log1p+rank, counts z-score, boundary one-hots, interruption ratio, record-vector | duration_ms, keystrokes, clicks, interruptions, row_count | app, document, url, titles |
| Routines | step-app hashes, dow-class one-hot, minute-of-day cyclic, support/opportunity scalars, cadence | confidence, support_days, occurrence_count, tolerance | schedule_label, step docs |
| Agent events | kind one-hot, model hash, tool hash, error one-hot, token-usage log-scalars, cost rate, cyclic time | input/output/cache tokens, duration | model, tool_name, spawn_id |
| Agent transcript lines | role one-hot, text sparse, token scalars, positional | line_no, ts | spawn_id |
| Actions | action-kind one-hot, target hash, params record-vector, cyclic time | magnitudes, timings | profile id |
| Process history | process hash, event one-hot, cyclic time, recency | pid, uptime | path |
| Reflex audit | reflex hash, outcome one-hot, latency scalars | latency | reflex id |
| Observations (sampled) | app hash, role histogram, entity multi-hot, HUD scalars, flags | element counts, dpi | process, title |

Cache/infra CFs (`CF_MODEL_CACHE`, `CF_OCR_CACHE`, `CF_PROFILES`, `CF_SESSIONS`, `CF_KV`) are stored as plain Kv/Blob collections — no panel (no intelligence question asked of them).

### 3.2 Anchors (grounded real outcomes — bits are measured about these)

| Anchor | Kind | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Routine confirmed / disabled / labeled | label | operator via `routine` tool (CF_ROUTINE_STATE transitions) |
| Approval granted / rejected | pass/fail | `approval` tool decisions |
| Agent end state (completed/failed/killed) | label | agent journal terminal events |
| Tool call error vs success | pass/fail | agent event error_type presence |
| Verification outcome | pass/fail | `verification` tool results |
| Episode interrupted vs completed | label | boundary + interruption fields |
| Escalation raised | label | `escalation` tool |
| Token cost bucket | reward | transcript usage rollups |
| Recurrence (routine occurred on schedule) | recurrence | episode evidence matcher |

Everything not yet anchored is reported **provisional** — the grounding-gap report names where anchors are missing.

## 4. Capability build-out (Compose — no blind spots)

| Calyx subsystem | Synapse surface | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Loom cross-terms + agreement/between-record graphs | `timeline`/`episode`/`find` | associations among apps, documents, times, agents; abundance report `n·(N + C(N,2) + 1)` |
| Assay bits/sufficiency/redundancy | new `intelligence` surface (extends `storage`/`hygiene`) | which captured fields actually predict outcomes, in bits; panel sufficiency deficits → propose-lens |
| Assay transfer entropy / Granger | `timeline` causality | "app A drives app B", agent-tool → failure arrows |
| Assay periodicity (Lomb–Scargle) + hazard | `routine` | rigorous cadence, overdue-ness, false-alarm probability — upgrades the hand-rolled miner |
| Lodestar kernel + kernel_answer | `episode`/`timeline` query, `find` | the ~1% of records that explain the corpus; grounded answers with hop-scored evidence paths |
| Sextant RRF fusion + BM25 + per-slot indexes | `find` | find-similar episodes/agent-runs/actions across all slots at once, temporal-boosted |
| Ward guard (conformal, per-slot, fail-closed) | `reality`/`verification`/`escalation` | out-of-distribution detection on observations and agent behavior; identity-lock confirmed routines; quarantine verdicts |
| Oracle predict / butterfly / reverse / completion | `assist`/`act`/`routine` | next-occurrence forecasts, consequence what-if before risky actions, root-cause abduction, honesty-gated imputation |
| Oracle readiness predicate | `health` | falsifiable per-domain "is this system ready" |
| Ledger hash chain + reproduce | `audit`/`privacy` | tamper-evident provenance for every mutation; `verify_chain`; redaction/erase honoring privacy |
| Loom reactive triggers | `subscribe` | new-region / recurs / drift events pushed to subscribers |
| Anneal | background | shadow-tested reversible tuning of fusion weights, quantization, thresholds; tripwires + rollback |
| Aster MVCC time-travel | `replay`/`storage` | consistent historical snapshots for replay debugging |
| TimeSeries rollups + OLAP columns | `cost`/`telemetry` | bounded-read cost/metric analytics at any corpus size (retires scan-bound cost queries, #1640 class) |

### 4.1 Control & steering (Calyx drives Synapse and the agents using it)

Beyond storing and analyzing, Calyx **controls** what it can do so with grounding, and steers everything else:

| Steered surface | Mechanism | Doctrine |
|---|---|---|
| Model routing (`model` tool) | bits + cost/success posteriors per model × task class | grounded ⇒ recommend with CI; ledger-logged |
| Tool selection at agent spawn (`agent` tool) | per-tool success bits + failure arrows (transfer entropy) | recommended/discouraged sets with evidence |
| Risky tool calls (destructive shell, deletes, sends) | pre-flight oracle what-if + ward OOD check | warn by default, deny per policy; honesty-gated; Insufficient ⇒ warn-only |
| Running agents | quarantine-grade drift verdicts → pause/kill recommendation via `escalation` | per-slot evidence attached |
| Routine arming / autonomy tiers | identity-lock + readiness predicate + periodicity confidence | fail closed: unready domains cannot arm |
| Proactive assist | kernel + graph next-step suggestions, overdue-hazard prompts | silent below the evidence floor |
| The MCP surface itself (`syn-mcp-usage-v1` panel) | Synapse measures its own tool calls; in-band `steering` hints in tool responses; `guide` action; annealed tool budgets & defaults | grounded+calibrated ⇒ may control; provisional ⇒ advise only; overrides become anchors |
| Hot paths (reflex/capture) | **lowering only**: frozen fingerprinted artifacts, async refresh | zero live Calyx calls in a tick |

## 5. Migration & cutover

1. Backend seam lands behind `storage_backend = "rocksdb" | "calyx"` config (default rocksdb).
2. `synapse-mcp storage migrate` — streams every CF row into the vault (pressure-bypass path, ledger-recorded), then verifies **byte-exact**: per-CF row counts equal + exhaustive key/value comparison; writes a migration manifest.
3. Shadow phase: daemon runs on calyx backend; FSV compares live behavior (timeline queries, episode segmentation, cost queries, replay) against expectations at the SoT.
4. Cutover: default flips to calyx; RocksDB directory renamed `db.rocksdb-retired` (kept until FSV sweep passes).
5. Decommission: `rocksdb` dependency and backend enum removed; retired directory deleted after operator confirmation.

## 6. Verification doctrine

Every issue ends with manual FSV (never automated, AGENTS.md D1): daemon PID/bind named, real MCP `tools/call` trigger, SoT read *after* the call (vault scan / ledger `verify_chain` / assay rows / kernel report - the actual bytes), evidence doc `docs/fsv/issue-<n>-...md`. Structural support is limited to `cargo check`, `cargo fmt --check`, and clippy gates; behavioral acceptance comes only from manual FSV against the physical Source of Truth.
