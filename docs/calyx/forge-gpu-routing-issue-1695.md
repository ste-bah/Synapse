# Forge GPU Routing for Synapse Workloads (#1695)

Date: 2026-07-16

## Purpose

Issue #1695 examined the PRD-listed Forge ops that Synapse will rely on during the Calyx integration. The root problem was not a blanket lack of CUDA. Forge already had working CUDA distance/top-k/KSG primitives, but two production-facing capabilities were not first-class backend operations:

- exact KNN was assembled ad hoc from lower-level distance/top-k calls, so callers could not audit backend support directly;
- Loom `agreement_batch_gpu` launched one CUDA cosine call per pair, making the GPU path much slower than CPU at real batch sizes.

## Source Sizing

The profile used the live Synapse daemon and current storage SoT:

| SoT | Value |
|---|---:|
| `synapse-mcp` bind | `127.0.0.1:7700` |
| MCP tool count | `40` |
| `CF_EPISODES` | `3,638` |
| `CF_TIMELINE` | `148,559` |
| CUDA device | `NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090` |

Manual profile artifact: `%TEMP%\synapse1695-profile\profile.json`, read back separately after the real MCP `shell` trigger.

## Profile Findings

| Workload | Profile size | CPU | CUDA/current | Decision |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| cosine top-k KNN | 8 queries x 3,638 candidates x dim 64, k=16 | 50.8 ms | 18.6 ms | ship first-class `Backend::knn` |
| Loom agreement pairs | 2,048 pairs x dim 64 | 2.0 ms | 202.9 ms | replace per-pair CUDA loop with `Backend::paired_cosine` |
| KSG counts | 512 rows | 118.2 ms | 2.2 ms | already shipped via assay CUDA path |
| timeline histogram NMI | 148,559 rows, 16 bins | 48.6 ms | not implemented | CPU-route until profile says otherwise |
| sparse postings | 3,638 rows, dim 4,096, row nnz 16 | 11.8 ms | not implemented | CPU-route until corpus scale requires GPU |
| ColBERT MaxSim | 3,638 docs, 4x8 tokens, dim 32 | 27.4 ms | not implemented | CPU-route until user-facing latency justifies GPU |

## Implemented Routing Contract

`calyx-forge` now exposes:

| Operation | Backend API | CPU | CUDA | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| exact KNN | `Backend::knn` | yes | yes | cosine/dot use exact top-k; L2 sorts ascending squared distance |
| paired cosine | `Backend::paired_cosine` | yes | yes | one row-pair per output scalar; Loom agreement uses this path |
| KSG counts | assay host functions | yes | yes | pre-existing CUDA path; profile confirmed parity on sampled counts |

`FORGE_DEFERRED_BACKEND_OPS` now contains only operations that remain absent as backend ops:

- `histogram_nmi`
- `spmm_sparse_ops`
- `graph_ops`
- `colbert_maxsim`

`FORGE_CPU_ROUTED_BACKEND_OPS` names the same list explicitly. This is deliberate: these operations are not silently claimed as GPU-ready, and callers can inspect the routing contract.

## Best-Practice Research Applied

- RAPIDS cuVS documents brute-force KNN as exact exhaustive nearest-neighbor search and notes that exact search is matrix-multiplication based. That supports using Forge's existing exact distance plus exact top-k primitives for profile-scale KNN instead of adding an approximate index inside Forge. Source: https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cuvs/stable/neighbors/bruteforce/
- NVIDIA cuSPARSE documents deterministic SpMV algorithms only for specific COO/CSR non-transpose modes, and recommends preprocessing when the same sparse matrix is reused. Sparse slot search currently has a small measured CPU cost; a future GPU sparse issue should use cuSPARSE-style CSR reuse and explicit determinism constraints instead of ad hoc kernels.

- NVIDIA's CUDA C++ Best Practices Guide calls out that parallel floating-point operation order can change numerical results. The new Forge result constructors validate finite outputs, shape, and bounds; manual FSV compares CPU/CUDA within tolerance rather than assuming bit-identical reduction order.

## Follow-On Rule

Do not add a new Forge GPU op because it is listed in the PRD. Add one only after a real Synapse profile identifies the CPU path as a bottleneck at the relevant corpus scale, then expose it as a named backend operation with CPU/CUDA implementations, strict shape validation, finite-output checks, and manual FSV evidence at the physical SoT.
