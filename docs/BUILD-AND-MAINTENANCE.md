# Build Speed And Disk Hygiene

This repo is tuned for fast iterative builds on the configured Windows dev host
and to prevent git worktree plus Cargo `target/` buildup from consuming the
system disk again.

## Build Settings

| Change | Where | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rust-lld` linker | `.cargo/config.toml` | Replaces slow MSVC `link.exe` for faster Windows linking. Missing linker state fails loudly. |
| Dev incremental compilation | `Cargo.toml [profile.dev]` | Rebuilds only changed codegen units during the edit loop. |
| Dependency debuginfo off | `Cargo.toml [profile.dev.package."*"]` | Avoids large dependency debug artifacts while keeping workspace panic line tables. |
| `jobs = 32` | user Cargo config | Uses the configured host's logical cores for local builds. |

Use the fast local edit loop:

```powershell
cargo check
cargo build
```

Use `cargo build --release` only when shipping or running the optimized daemon,
not as compile feedback during edits.

## CUDA Build Environment

The absorbed Calyx workspace has optional CUDA feature builds. On Windows with
CUDA 13.x, `nvcc` must be able to find MSVC `cl.exe`, and CUDA dependency
kernels need MSVC's conforming preprocessor. `scripts\synapse-setup.ps1`
repairs this configured-host state when CUDA is installed:

- `NVCC_CCBIN` -> Visual Studio `VC\Tools\MSVC\...\bin\Hostx64\x64`
- `NVCC_APPEND_FLAGS` includes `-Xcompiler=/Zc:preprocessor`

The CUDA compile check is:

```powershell
cargo check --manifest-path calyx\Cargo.toml --workspace --features "calyx-assay/cuda calyx-loom/cuda calyx-registry/cuda calyx-search/cuda calyx-sextant/cuda"
```

## Defender Exclusions

Defender real-time scanning of Cargo output can slow local builds. The helper
self-elevates and adds the repo build-output exclusions:

```powershell
pwsh -File .\scripts\add-defender-exclusions.ps1
```

## Chrome Policy Popup Shield

Synapse tries to write a reversible Chrome `ExtensionSettings` popup shield at
`HKCU:\Software\Policies\Google\Chrome\ExtensionSettings`. That policy blocks
debugger/nativeMessaging permissions for hazards that can surface Chrome popups
during background automation.

The intended ACL on a hardened configured host is admin-only for writes. It is
valid for the key owner to be `BUILTIN\Administrators` or `SYSTEM`, with the
medium-integrity user token limited to `ReadKey`. Do not weaken that ACL to make
normal setup write Chrome managed policy.

The policy shield is defense-in-depth, not the runtime enforcement boundary.
Runtime safety is the installed Synapse Chrome Bridge `chrome.management`
suppression readback plus daemon fail-closed command gates.

To apply the policy shield, use an elevated PowerShell from the repo:

```powershell
pwsh -File .\scripts\synapse-setup.ps1 -SourceDir C:\code\Synapse -ForceRestart
```

Then verify `mcp__synapse.health` reports
`synapse_chrome_self_policy_shield_present=true`. Without elevation, setup may
warn with `SYNAPSE_CHROME_POLICY_POPUP_SHIELD_WRITE_DENIED_NONBLOCKING`; the
required readback is that `chrome_bridge.status=ok`, live management suppression
has `remaining_hazard_count=0` and `failure_count=0`, and browser commands fail
closed if that suppression changes.

## Repo Maintenance

`scripts/repo-maintenance.ps1` is dry-run by default. It scans git repos under
`-Root` (default `C:\code`) and:

- prunes merged or remote-gone worktrees without touching active, dirty, or
  unmerged work;
- deletes local branches whose remote branch is gone;
- runs `cargo sweep` for stale build artifacts.

```powershell
pwsh -File .\scripts\repo-maintenance.ps1
pwsh -File .\scripts\repo-maintenance.ps1 -Apply
```

`scripts/install-maintenance-task.ps1` registers or removes the weekly
non-elevated Scheduled Task:

```powershell
pwsh -File .\scripts\install-maintenance-task.ps1
pwsh -File .\scripts\install-maintenance-task.ps1 -Remove
Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName SynapseRepoMaintenance
```

## Root Cause

Parallel issue work created many throwaway git worktrees, each with its own
multi-GB Cargo `target/`. Git does not automatically remove worktrees, and Cargo
does not garbage-collect old `target/` artifacts. Scheduled worktree pruning plus
`cargo sweep` keeps the checkout set and build artifacts bounded.

## MCP Helper Process Hygiene

Some external stdio MCP servers are launched as helper process trees under the
client that requested them. For the configured Exa launcher, the expected live
tree is:

```text
codex.exe or claude.exe
  -> cmd.exe ... C:\Users\hotra\.codex\bin\exa-mcp-server.cmd
      -> node.exe ... exa-mcp-server\smithery\stdio\index.cjs
```

Classify these helpers from the process table before cleanup:

- Live transport: wrapper `cmd.exe` parent is a live `codex.exe` or
  `claude.exe`, and the Exa `node.exe` parent is that wrapper PID. Leave it
  running; it belongs to an active MCP client.
- Owned probe: wrapper PID was spawned and recorded by the current operation.
  Close the MCP client first, then verify the wrapper and child PIDs are gone.
- Orphaned helper: wrapper/node command lines exactly match the Exa launcher,
  the parent client PID is absent, and no active client owns the tree. Cleanup
  may target only those exact helper PIDs after before/after process readback.

Never kill broad `cmd.exe`, terminal, IDE, WSL, Codex, or Claude process sets to
clean MCP helpers. If ownership cannot be proven, print the process Source of
Truth and leave the process running.
