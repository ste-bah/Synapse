//! Process-global, renewable, TTL-bounded **input lease** for the real
//! foreground/cursor/keyboard/clipboard (epic #719).
//!
//! Synapse runs one daemon serving many MCP sessions (one per agent terminal).
//! Background action tiers (CDP, UIA control patterns, `PostMessage`) touch no
//! shared OS input state and run in parallel without ever taking this lease.
//! Only a *leased foreground* action — a real `SendInput`/`SetPhysicalCursorPos`
//! that steals the single physical cursor/foreground — must own the lease.
//!
//! Semantics are **refuse, not block**: a contended `try_acquire` returns
//! [`LeaseOutcome::Busy`] with the current holder and a retry hint rather than
//! waiting, so an agent never deadlocks on another agent's foreground action.
//! The lease auto-expires lazily on TTL lapse, but a lapsed owner leaves a
//! pending cleanup record that blocks new acquisition until that session's
//! held-input ledger is drained. Session disconnect releases inputs and lease
//! through the same cleanup path, so a crashed agent cannot leave foreground
//! input stuck behind an unowned lease.
//!
//! The lock-free-at-rest static mirrors the [`crate::hotkey`] module's
//! process-global state pattern. The guard is a plain `std::sync::Mutex` held
//! only for the O(1) critical section — never across an `.await` or an action
//! emit — so [`status`] never blocks a health probe.
