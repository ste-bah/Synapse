//! Routine mining engine (#848, epic #830).
//!
//! Mines recurring routines from the episode stream (#846): frequent
//! contiguous episode-identity sequences combined with temporal regularity.
//! The engine is a PURE, DETERMINISTIC function of its inputs — same days +
//! same config produce identical routines including their ids — so mining
//! can be re-run whenever episodes change and the routine store is always
//! exactly one mining run's output.
//!
//! Method (grounded in periodic frequent-pattern mining practice — support
//! plus periodicity gates, PAMI/RPGrowth lineage — and circular statistics
//! for time-of-day data):
//!
//! - Each local day's eligible episodes become one identity sequence per
//!   granularity (`App`, `AppDocument`); consecutive identical identities
//!   collapse into one step (heartbeat-style coalescing).
//! - All contiguous n-grams (1..=`max_pattern_len`) are candidate patterns;
//!   occurrences carry their day, weekday, start minute, and episode ids.
//! - Occurrence start minutes live on the 1440-minute circle. Clusters are
//!   contiguous arcs split at circular gaps larger than
//!   [`RoutineMiningConfig::cluster_split_gap_minutes`]; a cluster wider
//!   than [`RoutineMiningConfig::max_cluster_spread_minutes`] has no stable
//!   time and is rejected (temporal-regularity gate). Cluster center is the
//!   circular mean; tolerance is the maximum circular deviation from it.
//! - Support is DISTINCT DAYS inside the cluster, gated by
//!   [`RoutineMiningConfig::min_support_days`]. Confidence is the Wilson
//!   95% lower bound of `support_days / opportunity_days`, where the
//!   denominator is active days matching the routine's day-of-week class —
//!   honest at low support by construction (single-user data is sparse by
//!   design, #828).
//! - Closed-pattern suppression: a routine whose every occurrence is
//!   episode-id-contained in a same-day occurrence of a more specific
//!   routine (longer template, or `AppDocument` over `App`) with identical
//!   support adds no information and is dropped — the classic closed
//!   sequential pattern reduction, keyed on physical episode ids rather
//!   than means so an independent same-template cluster at another time of
//!   day is never falsely suppressed.
//!
//! Everything not promoted is accounted for in [`RoutineMining`] counters —
//! nothing is silently skipped, and every cap that fires is visible.
