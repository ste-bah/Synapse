# Contributing to Synapse

Thanks for your interest in Synapse. This document covers how to propose changes
and, importantly, the **licensing terms for contributions** — Synapse is
dual-licensed (noncommercial + paid commercial), so contributions need to be
made under terms that keep that model possible.

## Licensing of contributions

By submitting a contribution (a pull request, patch, or any other work) to this
project, you agree that:

1. **You have the right to submit it.** The contribution is your original work,
   or you otherwise have the rights to submit it under these terms, and you sign
   off on it under the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)
   (use `git commit -s` to add a `Signed-off-by` line).
2. **You license it to the maintainer broadly.** You grant Chris Royse (the
   project maintainer / licensor) a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
   royalty-free, irrevocable copyright and patent license to use, reproduce,
   modify, distribute, and **sublicense** your contribution, **including the
   right to license it under the project's [PolyForm Noncommercial
   License](LICENSE.md) and under separate paid [commercial
   licenses](COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md)**.
3. **You keep your rights too.** You retain copyright in your contribution and
   may use it elsewhere. This grant is in addition to your own rights, not a
   transfer of them.

If you cannot agree to these terms, please do not submit a contribution. If your
employer has rights to work you create, make sure you have permission to
contribute under these terms before doing so.

## Before you start

For anything larger than a small fix, **open an issue first** to discuss the
approach. This avoids wasted work on changes that don't fit the architecture or
the roadmap (see the README "What's left on the docket" section).

## Development workflow

1. Use the toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` (currently Rust 1.96.1);
   rustup installs it automatically. The exact version is pinned so `cargo fmt`
   and `cargo clippy` are reproducible across contributors.
2. Build and check the workspace:
   ```bash
   cargo check --workspace
   cargo fmt --all --check
   cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
   ```
   The absorbed Calyx code lives in its own nested workspace under `calyx/`.
   When touching it, run the Calyx workspace gates separately:
   ```bash
   cargo check --manifest-path calyx/Cargo.toml --workspace
   cargo fmt --manifest-path calyx/Cargo.toml --all
   cargo clippy --manifest-path calyx/Cargo.toml --workspace --all-targets
   ```
   CUDA-enabled Calyx checks on Windows need `nvcc` plus an MSVC Hostx64
   compiler directory published through `NVCC_CCBIN`. CUDA 13.x also requires
   `NVCC_APPEND_FLAGS` to include `-Xcompiler=/Zc:preprocessor` so dependency
   CUDA kernels compile with MSVC's conforming preprocessor. `scripts/synapse-setup.ps1`
   detects and writes those user environment variables when CUDA is present.
   The full Calyx CUDA compile check is:
   ```bash
   cargo check --manifest-path calyx/Cargo.toml --workspace --features "calyx-assay/cuda calyx-loom/cuda calyx-registry/cuda calyx-search/cuda calyx-sextant/cuda"
   ```
3. **Enable the local pre-push gate (once per clone):**
   ```bash
   git config core.hooksPath .githooks
   ```
   This repo uses no CI (GitHub Actions are forbidden), so `.githooks/pre-push`
   is the automated backstop: it runs root fmt/clippy for root Rust/Cargo
   changes and separate Calyx fmt/clippy with `--manifest-path calyx/Cargo.toml`
   for `calyx/` Rust/Cargo changes (it skips docs-only pushes). It is a fast
   compile+lint gate, never a behavioral acceptance gate. Bypass only for a
   genuine non-compiling emergency with
   `git push --no-verify`.
4. **Iterate with fast builds.** Use `cargo check` (~15 s) or `cargo build`
   (dev, ~45 s incremental) for the edit loop. Run `cargo build --release` ONLY
   to ship/run the real `synapse-mcp.exe` daemon — never as compile feedback.
   See [docs/BUILD-AND-MAINTENANCE.md](docs/BUILD-AND-MAINTENANCE.md) for the
   tuned profiles (rust-lld, thin-LTO release, `--profile release-max` for the
   max-runtime binary) and the worktree/`target` disk-hygiene tooling
   (`scripts/repo-maintenance.ps1`) — don't leave throwaway worktrees with their
   own multi-GB `target/` lying around.
4. Synapse is **Windows-native** for its real perception/action paths (Win32
   `SendInput`, UI Automation, WGC/DXGI). Behavior that touches those
   surfaces should be verified on Windows — the project uses manual Full State
   Verification (FSV) on the configured Windows host as the shipping gate (see the
   README "Agent Doctrine" section). Automated tests are not part of the
   acceptance surface.
5. Keep commits focused and write clear messages. Reference the issue number
   where applicable.

## Pull requests

- Keep PRs scoped to one logical change.
- Include the reasoning and any verification you performed.
- Make sure `cargo fmt --check` and the build pass locally before requesting
  review.
- Sign off your commits (`git commit -s`) to assert the DCO and the contribution
  terms above.
