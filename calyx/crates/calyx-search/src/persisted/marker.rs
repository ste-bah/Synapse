//! Durable vault-level "search index rebuild required" marker (issue #1089).
//!
//! Base CF commits and the derived search-index rebuild are separate steps, so
//! an external kill (CLI timeout, power loss) between them leaves durable rows
//! with a stale `idx/search/manifest.json` and nothing on disk that says so.
//! This marker is the write-ahead intent record for that gap:
//!
//! * every mutation path writes the marker BEFORE it advances the Base CF, and
//! * the rebuild removes it only AFTER the new manifest is durably published,
//!
//! so at any crash point the vault either has a fresh manifest or a marker
//! naming the exact commit that made the derived state stale. Searches keep
//! failing closed via the existing manifest seq check; the marker exists so
//! operators and FSV automation get a first-class, structured record instead
//! of having to infer staleness by recomputing seq comparisons.
