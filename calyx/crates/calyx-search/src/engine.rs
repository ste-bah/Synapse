//! The shared search query path: measure the query through the active text
//! lenses, recall per slot from the persisted indexes, fuse (RRF / weighted /
//! pipeline / single-lens), attach stored provenance, optionally apply the
//! in-region guard, then rank+truncate. Extracted from the CLI (#573) so the
//! CLI and `calyx-web-api` run the IDENTICAL path. Takes an already-opened
//! vault + panel state (the caller owns vault lifecycle); never resolves a CLI
//! home and never prints — failures are structured errors.
