//! VRAM budgeting + admission control for `calyx-forge`.
//!
//! `calyx-forge` can share a single CUDA GPU with co-resident embedding and
//! telemetry services. Every large GPU dispatch must therefore be
//! *admitted* against two independent limits before it runs:
//!
//! 1. a **soft cap** (`CALYX_FORGE_VRAM_BUDGET`) on Forge's own cumulative
//!    allocation, enforced by an atomic usage counter shared across subsystems;
//! 2. the **live device free-VRAM headroom**, queried per-dispatch via
//!    `cudaMemGetInfo` so the budgeter never assumes a fixed 32 GiB and always
//!    yields to whatever the TEI residents are currently using.
//!
//! The accounting logic ([`VramBudgeter`]) is intentionally generic over a
//! [`VramProbe`] — the hardware boundary. In production the probe is
//! [`CudaVramProbe`], which calls `cudaMemGetInfo` on the real device. In unit
//! tests a deterministic probe supplies a known free-VRAM value so the
//! soft-cap / headroom decision logic can be exercised with hand-computed
//! byte counts on a CPU-only box. The system under test (the accounting) runs
//! on real bytes; only the external GPU reading is injected.
