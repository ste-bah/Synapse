//! Time-travel reads: `as_of(t)` over MVCC time-keyed snapshots.
//!
//! `as_of` resolves a wall-clock timestamp to the greatest committed seqno at or
//! before it (via the [`time_index`] CF) and opens an MVCC snapshot pinned at
//! that seqno. The caller then reads any CF at that snapshot as if it were
//! `now`. The pin is released on [`Drop`] so version GC can proceed with no
//! leaked leases (A26). The time-index entry for each write is committed inside
//! the same WAL group-commit batch as the data (see `vault::commit`), so a crash
//! can never leave a write without its time mapping (A15).
